#Justice Tools
This is a little flask project i made at 3 in the morning. 
It has a few tools like a discord embed generator, a insult
generator, a notes app, etc. It has an account system aswell!

The entire thing uses flask and sqlalchemy for the DB.
DHooks for the embed, and some built in python requests for usage of the
insult API.

This should only be used as a flask learning example. Its probably hackable
and has no purpose? I dont sanatize any of the SQL lol.
